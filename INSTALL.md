# DynaRESF Installation

## Installation on Debian Testing

### Dynare Installation

As `root`:
```bash
apt install dynare
# apt install octave
```

The new system build of the preprocessor is not yet official.

In the mean time, you can download it from [St√©phane Adjemian personal site](https://dynare.adjemian.eu/preprocessor/).

Extract `dynare_m` file.

As `root`, replace Debian `dynare_m` executables with the new version:
```bash
cp dynare_m /usr/lib/dynare/matlab/dynare_m
cp dynare_m /usr/lib/dynare/matlab/preprocessor64/dynare_m
```

As user:
```bash
octave --eval "dynare model.mod"
    warning: This version of Octave is not supported. Consider installing version 4.2.1 of Octave,
    otherwise m files will be used instead of precompiled mex files and some features, like solution
    of models approximated at third order, will not be available.
